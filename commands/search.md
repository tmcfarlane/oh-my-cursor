Use Toph (the search specialist agent) for multi-angle exploration.

Search the codebase AND external documentation in parallel:
- Use Grep, Glob, and SemanticSearch for internal codebase patterns
- Use WebSearch and WebFetch for external docs and best practices
- Analyze any referenced media files (PDFs, images, diagrams)

Return structured results with absolute file paths, a direct answer to the actual need, and clear next steps.
