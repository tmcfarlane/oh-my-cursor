Analyze the following request using Sokka (the strategist agent) for the full planning pipeline:

1. **Ambiguity Analysis**: Classify the intent type (refactoring, build, mid-sized, architecture, research). Identify hidden requirements, AI failure points, and scope boundaries.

2. **Codebase Exploration**: Search the codebase for relevant patterns, existing implementations, and conventions that should inform the plan.

3. **Strategic Plan**: Create a detailed work plan with ordered tasks, file references, dependencies, and executable acceptance criteria.

4. **Self-Review**: Review the plan for blocking issues -- do referenced files exist? Can each task be started? Any contradictions?

Present the reviewed plan before execution. Do NOT begin implementing until I confirm.
