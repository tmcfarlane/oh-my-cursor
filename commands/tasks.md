Use Appa (the systematic executor agent) to work through this task list.

1. Parse the tasks and their dependencies.
2. Create a todo list tracking every item.
3. Execute tasks one at a time, verifying after each.
4. For independent tasks, fan out to parallel Momo workers.
5. Provide a final structured report of what was completed.

Do not stop until all tasks are done or blocked with documented reasons.
