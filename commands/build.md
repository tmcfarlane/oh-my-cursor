Use Aang (the deep executor agent) for this implementation task.

1. **Explore** the relevant codebase areas to understand existing patterns and context.
2. **Plan** the specific changes needed, creating a todo list for multi-step work.
3. **Execute** the changes, matching existing codebase conventions.
4. **Verify** with ReadLints, build, and tests after every change.

Keep going until completely done. Do not stop for confirmation mid-implementation.
